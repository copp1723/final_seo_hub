## Testing the Webhook

### Using cURL
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-app.com/api/seoworks/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET" \
  -d '{
    "eventType": "task.completed",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-09T10:00:00Z",
    "data": {
      "externalId": "req_123",
      "clientId": "user_123",
      "taskType": "page",
      "status": "completed",
      "deliverables": [{
        "type": "page",
        "title": "Test Page Title",
        "url": "https://example.com/test"
      }]
    }
  }'
```

### Using the Test Script
Create a file `test-webhook.js`:
```javascript
const fetch = require('node-fetch');

async function testWebhook(taskType, title, url) {
  const response = await fetch('https://your-app.com/api/seoworks/webhook', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'x-api-key': process.env.SEOWORKS_WEBHOOK_SECRET
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      eventType: 'task.completed',
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      data: {
        externalId: 'req_demo_' + Date.now(),
        clientId: 'user_demo',
        taskType: taskType,
        status: 'completed',
        deliverables: [{
          type: taskType,
          title: title,
          url: url
        }]
      }
    })
  });

  console.log('Response:', await response.json());
}

// Test different content types
testWebhook('page', '2024 Honda Accord Deals', 'https://dealership.com/honda-accord');
```

## Key Points to Highlight

1. **Automatic Notifications**: No manual intervention needed - notifications are sent automatically when content is completed

2. **Professional Design**: Mobile-responsive, branded emails that look professional

3. **Clear Value Communication**: Each email explains why the content matters for SEO

4. **Progress Tracking**: Package users see their monthly progress in every email

5. **Direct Links**: One-click access to view the new content

6. **Respects Preferences**: Users can manage their notification preferences

## Troubleshooting

### Email Not Received
1. Check user preferences: `/settings`
2. Check Mailgun logs
3. Verify webhook secret is correct
4. Check application logs for errors

### Wrong Template Used
- Verify task type is one of: page, blog, gbp-post, gbp_post
- Other task types use the generic template

### Missing Progress Stats
- Ensure the request has a `packageType` set
- Progress only shows for package users

## Email Preview Files
Preview HTML files are available in `/email-previews/`:
- `page-notification.html` - New page example
- `blog-notification.html` - Blog post example
- `gbp-notification.html` - Google Business Profile post
- `improvement-notification.html` - Website improvement
- `no-url-notification.html` - Content without a URL

Open these files in a browser to show how emails will appear to recipients.

## Success Metrics
- Dealerships can SEE the work being done
- Clear subject lines grab attention
- Professional design builds trust
- Direct links drive engagement
- Progress tracking shows value
