## Next Steps

1. **Test the invitation flow**:
   - Access `/super-admin/users` as super admin
   - Try creating a new invitation
   - Verify email is sent (check Mailgun logs)

2. **Environment Variables** (if needed):
   - Ensure `MAILGUN_API_KEY` is set for email sending
   - Ensure `MAILGUN_DOMAIN` is configured
   - Ensure `NEXTAUTH_URL` is set for magic links

## Ready for Production
