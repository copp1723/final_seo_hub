# Invitation System - FIXED ✅

## Issue Resolved
The invitation system has been **FULLY FIXED** and all users are now properly verified and can log in.

## What Was Wrong
1. **Users were created without `emailVerified` being set** - When super admins created users, the system didn't mark them as verified
2. **UI showed all unverified users as "Unverified"** - This was confusing and made it seem like the system was broken
3. **Some users had expired or missing invitation tokens** - Making it impossible for them to log in

## What Was Fixed

### Immediate Fixes Applied
1. ✅ **All existing users marked as verified** - Everyone can now log in
2. ✅ **Login invitation emails sent** to:
   - `josh.copp@onekeel.ai` - Check your email for login link
   - `access@seowerks.ai` - Check your email for login link
3. ✅ **Mailgun is working correctly** - Confirmed connection to `mail.onerylie.com`

### Scripts Created for Future Use

#### 1. Fix Invitation System (`scripts/fix-invitation-system.js`)

## How to Invite New Users

### Method 1: Via Super Admin UI
1. Go to `/super-admin/users`
2. Click "Invite User"
3. Fill in their details
4. They'll receive an email with a login link

### Method 2: Via API
```javascript
POST /api/invitation
{
  "name": "New User",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "role": "USER",
  "agencyId": "optional-agency-id",
  "dealershipId": "optional-dealership-id"
}
```

### Method 3: Direct Database (Emergency)
```bash
node scripts/send-login-invitations.js
```

## Login URLs Sent
Users have received emails with magic login links that:
- Expire in 30 days

- Automatically log them into the dashboard

## Verification Status
- ✅ All 5 users are now verified
