# Deployment Error Analysis

## Identified Issues:

### 1. Missing Files Referenced in Build
The TypeScript compiler is trying to compile files that don't exist:
- `app/(authenticated)/tasks/page.tsx` - MISSING
- `components/tasks/task-card.tsx` - MISSING  
- `components/dashboard/task-widget.tsx` - MISSING
- `components/requests/enhanced-request-card.tsx` - MISSING
- `components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx` - MISSING
- `components/ui/progress.tsx` - MISSING
- `app/(authenticated)/reporting/components/OverviewTab.tsx` - MISSING
- `app/(authenticated)/reporting/components/SearchTab.tsx` - MISSING

### 2. Missing Dependencies
- `@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu` - NOT in package.json
- `@radix-ui/react-progress` - NOT in package.json

### 3. Badge Variant Type Mismatch
Current badge variants: "default" | "success" | "warning" | "error" | "info"
Code is using: "secondary" | "outline" | "destructive"

### 4. Button Variant Type Mismatch  
Current button variants: "primary" | "secondary" | "ghost" | "outline"
Code is using: "destructive" | "default"

### 5. API Function Signature Error
Line 104 in usage route: `logger.info('Usage API response data:', responseData, { userId: authResult.user.id })`
Logger expects 1-2 arguments but got 3.

## Root Cause:
The codebase appears to have been partially refactored or files were deleted, but TypeScript is still trying to compile references to the old files. This suggests either:
1. Git references to deleted files
2. Import statements pointing to non-existent files
3. Build cache issues
