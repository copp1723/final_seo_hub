git commit -m "Fix SEOWorks integration and webhook handling

- Fixed SEOWorksTaskMapping model relation in schema
- Enhanced webhook to handle tasks created directly in SEOWorks
- Added fallback matching by clientId when no direct task mapping exists
- Store SEOWorks taskId from API responses for better tracking
- Temporarily simplified request creation to avoid 500 errors
- Auto-create requests for externally created tasks when completed

This ensures all task updates from SEOWorks are properly tracked regardless of origin."

echo "3. Jeff can start sending webhook updates"
echo "4. Test creating a new focus request"
