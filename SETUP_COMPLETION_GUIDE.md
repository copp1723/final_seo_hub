# üöÄ SEO Hub Setup Completion Guide

## Current Status
Based on analysis, your OAuth integration is **already implemented** but you're experiencing authentication issues due to configuration problems.

## ‚úÖ What's Already Working
1. **OAuth Endpoints** - GA4 and Search Console OAuth flows are implemented
2. **Token Storage** - Encrypted tokens stored in `ga4_connections` table  
3. **Analytics Endpoint** - Properly fetches from correct tables
4. **Dealership Dropdown** - Triggers data refresh on selection
5. **Multi-tenant Support** - Each dealership can have separate connections

## ‚ùå What Was Broken (Now Fixed)
1. **Debug Auto-Login** - Removed security vulnerability
2. **JWT Secret Mismatch** - Fixed to use consistent secret
3. **Login Page** - Now uses proper email authentication

## üîß What You Need to Do

### 1. Set Environment Variables (CRITICAL)
```bash
# In your production environment (Render.com)
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://rylie-seo-hub.onrender.com
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<generate-32-char-secret>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<your-actual-client-id>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-actual-client-secret>
ENCRYPTION_KEY=<generate-32-char-key>
NODE_ENV=production
```

**To generate secrets:**
```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

### 2. Create Your Agency Admin User
```bash
# Update email in scripts/create-agency-admin.js first!
node scripts/create-agency-admin.js
```

### 3. Configure Google OAuth
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Add authorized redirect URIs:
   - `https://rylie-seo-hub.onrender.com/api/ga4/auth/callback`
   - `https://rylie-seo-hub.onrender.com/api/search-console/callback`

### 4. Run Setup Check
```bash
node scripts/check-setup-status.js
```

## üì± Usage Flow

### Login as Agency Admin
1. Go to `/login`
2. Enter your email (created in step 2)
3. You'll be redirected to dashboard

### Connect GA4/Search Console
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Integrations
2. Click "Connect GA4" ‚Üí Authorize with Google
3. Click "Connect Search Console" ‚Üí Authorize with Google

### View Analytics
1. On Dashboard, select a dealership from dropdown
2. Analytics will load automatically
3. Switch dealerships to see different data

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Need Incognito Mode" Issue
- **Cause**: Cookie configuration mismatch
- **Fix**: Clear all cookies at `/api/debug/clear-cookies`

### "No Data" in Dashboard
1. Check if dealership has GA4 property configured
2. Verify OAuth connection in Settings ‚Üí Integrations
3. Ensure user has permission for selected GA4 property

### OAuth Fails
1. Verify environment variables are set
2. Check redirect URIs in Google Console
3. Ensure HTTPS is working (required for secure cookies)

## üéØ Success Checklist
- [ ] Environment variables set in production
- [ ] Agency admin user created
- [ ] Google OAuth configured with correct redirect URIs
- [ ] Can login without incognito mode
- [ ] Can connect GA4/Search Console
- [ ] Can see real data when selecting dealerships

1. Run `node scripts/check-setup-status.js` for diagnostics
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Review server logs on Render.com
