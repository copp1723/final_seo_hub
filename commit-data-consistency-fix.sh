git commit -m "Fix GA4 and Search Console data consistency issues

BREAKING CHANGES:
- All API routes now use dynamic rendering (fixes static build errors)
- Simplified connection logic (removes failing dealership-specific lookups)
- Consolidated duplicate Search Console routes

FIXES:
- Added 'export const dynamic = force-dynamic' to all auth-based routes
- Fixed token expiration handling with clear error messages
- Removed complex dealership-specific connection lookups
- Consolidated search-console/list-sites into search-console/sites
- Improved error visibility for expired tokens
- Added proper caching without hiding errors

IMPROVEMENTS:
- Created reusable route utilities in /lib/api/route-utils.ts
- Created centralized Search Console API in /lib/api/search-console-api.ts
- Simplified DealershipAnalyticsService to use user-level connections only
- Standardized error responses across all routes
- Better logging for debugging data fetch issues

CLEANUP:
- Moved old list-sites route to _deprecated_list-sites
- Moved duplicate analytics service files to _deprecated_*
- All routes now use consistent SimpleAuth pattern

This should resolve the 'nightmare' of inconsistent data loading on dashboard
and reporting pages. Users will now see clear error messages when tokens
expire and need to reconnect in settings."
