=== BUILD ERROR DIAGNOSIS ===
Timestamp: 2025-01-10 18:57:04

IDENTIFIED ISSUES:

1. MISSING REQUIRED FIELDS IN PRISMA SCHEMA:
   - GA4Connection.accessToken is required (line 279 in schema.prisma)
   - SearchConsoleConnection.accessToken is required (line 320 in schema.prisma)
   - But code is trying to create these without accessToken

2. UNKNOWN PROPERTY ERROR:
   - Code tries to set 'onboardingCompleted' on Dealership model
   - But Dealership model doesn't have this field (only User model has it)

3. PRISMA QUERY SYNTAX ERROR:
   - Cannot use both 'select' and 'include' in same query (line 102-106 in search-console/performance/route.ts)

4. UNDEFINED VARIABLE ERROR:
   - 'session' variable used outside scope (line 86 in bulk-create/route.ts)

5. TOAST API USAGE ERROR:
   - toast() expects string but receiving object with title/description

VALIDATION LOGS TO ADD:
- Check if accessToken is actually required in current schema
- Verify if onboardingCompleted should be on Dealership or User
- Confirm session scope issue
- Test toast API expectations
