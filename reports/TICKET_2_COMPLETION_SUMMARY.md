# Ticket 2: Custom 404 and 500 Error Pages - COMPLETED ✅

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented custom error pages for the Rylie SEO Hub application following Next.js 13+ app router conventions and maintaining consistency with the existing design system.

## Files Created

1. **`app/not-found.tsx`** - Custom 404 error page
2. **`app/error.tsx`** - App-level error handler for runtime errors  
3. **`app/global-error.tsx`** - Global error handler for severe application errors

## Acceptance Criteria Status

### ✅ app/404.tsx and app/500.tsx exist and are functional
- **Note**: In Next.js 13+ app router, the correct file names are:
  - `not-found.tsx` for 404 errors (follows Next.js conventions)
  - `error.tsx` and `global-error.tsx` for 500/runtime errors
- All files exist and are fully functional
- Proper TypeScript typing and error handling implemented

### ✅ Pages are styled and branded appropriately
- Consistent "Rylie SEO Hub" branding throughout all error pages
- Uses existing Tailwind CSS design system with custom CSS variables
- Reuses UI components (Button, Card, etc.) from `components/ui/`
- Lucide React icons for consistent iconography
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Matches the app's gray-50 background and styling patterns

### ✅ Users are provided with a way to navigate back to the dashboard or home
- **404 Page Navigation Options**:
  - Primary "Go to Dashboard" button
  - Secondary "Browse Requests" button  
  - "Go Back" button (browser history)
  - Link to AI Assistant for support
- **Error Pages Navigation Options**:
  - "Try Again" button to retry the failed operation
  - "Go to Dashboard" button as fallback
  - Link to AI Assistant for support

### ✅ Error pages are triggered correctly in both development and production
- **404 Errors**: Automatically triggered for non-existent routes
- **Runtime Errors**: Caught by error boundaries with proper error display
- **Development Mode**: Shows detailed error information for debugging
- **Production Mode**: Hides sensitive error details while maintaining user-friendly messaging
- Error logging implemented for monitoring purposes

## Technical Implementation Details

### Error Page Hierarchy
1. `global-error.tsx` - Handles the most severe errors that break the entire app
2. `error.tsx` - Handles errors within app directory routes
3. `not-found.tsx` - Specifically handles 404 Not Found errors

### Design System Integration
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with existing color palette and spacing
- **Components**: Button variants (primary, secondary, ghost), Card components
- **Icons**: Home, Search, ArrowLeft, RefreshCw, AlertTriangle from Lucide
- **Typography**: Inter font matching the main application
- **Layout**: Centered layout with max-width constraints and proper spacing

### User Experience Features
- Clear error messaging without technical jargon
- Multiple navigation paths to help users recover
- Visual hierarchy with prominent error codes/icons
- Support links to AI Assistant
- Accessible design with proper semantic HTML

### Developer Experience Features
- TypeScript support with proper error typing
- Error logging for monitoring and debugging
- Development-only error detail display
- Follows Next.js best practices and conventions

## Testing

Error pages can be tested by:
1. **404 Page**: Visit any non-existent URL (e.g., `/non-existent-page`)
2. **Error Page**: Any runtime error in the application will trigger the error boundary
3. Both pages are accessible and functional in development and production environments

## Browser Compatibility

All error pages are compatible with modern browsers supporting:
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- ES6+ JavaScript features  
- Next.js 13+ app router functionality

## Documentation

Created `ERROR_PAGES_IMPLEMENTATION.md` with comprehensive documentation including:
- Technical implementation details
- Design system integration
- Testing instructions
- Accessibility considerations
- Future enhancement suggestions
