# MP-001: Future-Proof Data Model Implementation Summary

## Ticket Overview
**Scope**: Design dealership/property model compatible with GA4 360 migration  
**Status**: âœ… Complete

## Key Deliverables

### 1. Prisma Schema Updates (`/workspace/prisma/schema.prisma`)

Added two new models to support multi-property GA4 analytics:

#### Dealership Model
```prisma
model Dealership {
  id              String   @id @default(cuid())
  agencyId        String
  
  // GA4 Integration - compatible with both approaches
  ga4PropertyId       String?  // For custom approach (current)
  ga4SubpropertyId    String?  // For GA4 360 migration (future)
  ga4SourcePropertyId String?  // Parent property for 360
  
  // Filtering metadata (matches GA4 360 filter capabilities)
  filterCriteria  Json?    // Store filter rules for subproperty creation
  
  // ... other fields
}
```

#### DealershipGA4Connection Model
Supports multiple GA4 connections per dealership with different types:
- `primary`: Main GA4 property
- `secondary`: Additional properties
- `rollup`: GA4 360 roll-up property

### 2. TypeScript Types (`/workspace/types/dealership.ts`)

Created comprehensive type definitions including:
- `DealershipFilterCriteria`: Compatible with both custom and GA4 360 filter formats
- `DealershipAnalyticsConfig`: Configuration for tracking and measurement
- `DealershipMetrics`: Standardized metrics interface
- `AggregatedAnalytics`: Agency-level aggregated data structure

### 3. Migration Guide (`/workspace/docs/ga4-360-migration-guide.md`)

Documented the complete migration path including:
- Data model compatibility between approaches
- Step-by-step migration process
- API pattern changes
- Filter criteria mapping
- Rollback strategy

### 4. Implementation Example (`/workspace/lib/dealership-analytics.example.txt`)

Provided code examples demonstrating:
- Dual-mode analytics fetching (custom vs GA4 360)
- Aggregation logic for both approaches
- Migration helper functions
- GA4 360 compatible filter creation

## Architectural Decisions

### 1. Dual-Field Strategy
The schema includes both `ga4PropertyId` (current) and `ga4SubpropertyId` (future) to enable:
- Gradual migration without breaking changes
- A/B testing between approaches
- Safe rollback if needed

### 2. Filter Criteria Storage
The `filterCriteria` JSON field stores filtering rules in a format that:
- Works with current custom aggregation
- Maps directly to GA4 360 subproperty filters
- Preserves configuration for future migration

### 3. Flexible Connection Model
The `DealershipGA4Connection` model allows:
- Multiple GA4 properties per dealership
- Different connection types (primary, rollup)
- Encrypted credential storage
- Connection-specific configuration

### 4. Relationship Updates
Updated existing models:
- Added `dealerships` relation to Agency
- Added `dealershipId` to User and Request models
- Maintained backward compatibility

## Benefits

1. **Zero-Downtime Migration**: Can run both systems in parallel
2. **Future-Proof**: Direct mapping to GA4 360 concepts
3. **Flexible**: Supports various analytics configurations
4. **Performant**: Includes caching mechanisms
5. **Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript support

## Next Steps

1. Generate Prisma migrations: `npx prisma migrate dev`
2. Update API endpoints to use new dealership model
3. Implement GA4 API integration functions
4. Create UI for dealership management
5. Set up analytics aggregation workers
