    "taskType": "blog",
    "status": "completed",

    "deliverables": [
      {
        "type": "blog",
        "title": "Blog Title Here",

Content-Type: application/json

⚙️ How It Works
You send task data → our server receives and processes it.


If dealership exists → task shows up immediately in their dashboard.


If dealership not set up yet → task is stored and processed later automatically ("stored_for_later_processing").



📌 Examples
Example 1: Blog Post for Acura of Columbus
curl -X POST https://rylie-seo-hub.onrender.com/api/seoworks/webhook \
  -H "x-api-key: 7f3e9b5d2a8c4f6e1b9d3c7a5e8f2b4d6c9a1e3f7b5d9c2a6e4f8b1d3c7a9e5f" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{

🛠️ Troubleshooting
Q: What if I don’t know the dealership ID?
A: Use a logical placeholder (e.g., dealer-ford-seattle). We’ll map it later.
Q: Can I send multiple deliverables in one request?
A: Yes. Include multiple items in the deliverables array.
Q: What happens to tasks for dealerships not in the system?
A: We store them and auto-link once the dealership is onboarded.
Q: Do I need to retry failed requests?
A: No. If you receive a 200 OK, it was received—even if stored for later.

 
Reminder: You can send task data for any dealership. Even if they’re not in the system yet, we’ll handle the rest.
