- Simplified connection logic (removed failing dealership-specific lookups)
- Fixed token expiration handling with clear error messages
- Consolidated search-console/list-sites into search-console/sites
- Created reusable utilities: route-utils.ts and search-console-api.ts
- Improved DealershipAnalyticsService for better error handling
- Cleaned up duplicate files (moved to _deprecated_*)

Fixes the inconsistent data loading on dashboard and reporting pages"
