# Build Fix Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. TypeScript Errors in `scripts/fix-user-fields.ts`

**Problem**: The script was using `null` in Prisma where clauses, which is incompatible with non-nullable field types.

**Solution**: 
- Removed the where clause filtering since the fields have default values in the Prisma schema
- Changed approach to fetch all users and check for missing values in the loop
- This ensures compatibility with Prisma's type system

### 2. ErrorBoundary Import Error in `app/(authenticated)/dashboard/page.tsx`

**Problem**: ErrorBoundary was being dynamically imported inside an async Server Component, causing a "Cannot find name" error.

**Solution**: 
- Moved the ErrorBoundary import to the top of the file with other imports
- Since ErrorBoundary is a client component, it can be imported normally in Server Components

## Recommendations to Prevent Future Issues

### 1. Type Safety with Prisma

- When querying with Prisma, remember that fields with default values in the schema are non-nullable
- Use proper Prisma filter operators for nullable fields (e.g., `{ field: { equals: null } }` for nullable fields)
- For non-nullable fields with defaults, check values after fetching rather than in the where clause

### 2. Component Imports

- Import client components at the top of Server Components files
- Avoid dynamic imports inside Server Components unless necessary for code splitting
- Use static imports for components that are always needed

### 3. Build Testing

- Always run `npm run type-check` before deploying to catch TypeScript errors early
- Consider adding a pre-commit hook to run type checking
- Set up CI/CD to run type checks on pull requests

### 4. Script Best Practices

- When writing database migration scripts:
  - Handle edge cases where data might be in unexpected states
  - Use proper type guards when checking for null/undefined values
  - Add proper error handling and logging
  - Test scripts locally before deploying

### 5. Environment Variables

- The build will fail if required environment variables are missing
- Ensure all required variables are set in your deployment environment:
  - `DATABASE_URL`
  - `NEXTAUTH_URL`
  - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`
  - `ENCRYPTION_KEY`

## Type Error Prevention Checklist

- [ ] Run `npm run type-check` before commits
- [ ] Review Prisma schema for field nullability before writing queries
- [ ] Import all components at the top of files
- [ ] Test scripts with edge cases before deployment
- [ ] Ensure environment variables are properly configured
