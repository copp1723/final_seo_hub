## Chat Input Fix Status

**Issue**: Chat input field is blocked by CSS overlay
**Root Cause**: Card component's `::before` pseudo-element intercepting pointer events
**Fixes Applied**:

1. ✅ Added `before:pointer-events-none` to Card component
2. ✅ Added `[&::before]:pointer-events-none` to chat Card specifically  
3. ✅ Added `relative z-10` to form container
4. ✅ Added `relative z-20` and `style={{ pointerEvents: 'auto' }}` to input field

**Deployment Timestamp**: $(date)
**Commit Hash**: 9f24198f69cfdce89d1bafab93e9b61b2670879e

## Expected Result
After this deployment, users should be able to:
- Click in the chat input field
- Type messages normally
- Send messages successfully

## Verification
Check that the Card element includes `before:pointer-events-none` in its className.
