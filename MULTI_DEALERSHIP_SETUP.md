## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Dealership Switcher Not Visible"

**Cause**: User has access to only one dealership or no multi-access permissions

**Solution**:
1. Verify user has access to multiple dealerships
2. Check user role (appears for USER and DEALERSHIP_ADMIN)
3. Contact SUPER_ADMIN to grant additional access

#### "Cannot Switch Dealership"

**Cause**: Session or permission issues

**Solutions**:
1. **Refresh browser session**:
   ```
   Logout and login again
   Clear browser cache
   ```

2. **Verify permissions**:
   ```
   Check access hasn't expired
   Confirm dealership is still active
   Verify user still has required permissions
   ```

#### "Access Denied After Switching"

**Cause**: Insufficient permissions for specific actions

**Solution**:
1. Check current access level (visible in switcher)
2. Contact admin to upgrade permissions if needed
3. Verify action requires your current access level

### Error Messages

| Error | Meaning | Resolution |
|-------|---------|------------|
| "No dealership access found" | User has no multi-dealership permissions | Contact SUPER_ADMIN for setup |
| "Access expired" | User's access has passed expiration date | Request access renewal |
| "Invalid dealership" | Trying to access non-existent dealership | Verify dealership still exists |
| "Insufficient permissions" | Action requires higher access level | Request permission upgrade |
