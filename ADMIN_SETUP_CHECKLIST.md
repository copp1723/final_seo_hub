## üö® Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### "Bulk assignment failed"
**Cause**: Database constraints or invalid data
**Fix**: 
1. Check user IDs exist
2. Verify dealership IDs valid
3. Ensure no duplicate assignments
4. Review error logs for specifics

#### "User can't see dealership switcher"
**Cause**: User has single dealership access
**Fix**:
1. Verify user has 2+ dealership permissions
2. Check user role (USER or DEALERSHIP_ADMIN)
3. Confirm permissions are active and not expired

#### "Access denied after switching"
**Cause**: Insufficient permissions for current dealership
**Fix**:
1. Verify user's access level for that dealership
2. Check if access has expired
3. Confirm dealership is still active

### Database Issues

#### Check User Access
```sql
SELECT u.email, d.name, uda.accessLevel, uda.isActive
FROM user_dealership_access uda
JOIN users u ON uda.userId = u.id
JOIN dealerships d ON uda.dealershipId = d.id
WHERE u.email = 'user@example.com';
```

#### Verify Migration
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'user_dealership_access';
```
