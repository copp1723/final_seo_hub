# Analytics Error Handling Fix

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to fix the 401 authentication errors in the analytics dashboard and reporting pages.

## Issues Fixed
1. 401 errors when fetching GA4 data
2. 401 errors when fetching Search Console data
3. Reference errors to undefined properties in the Search Console data
4. Reference to non-existent `mockGA4Properties` variable

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Mock Data Providers
- Added `/lib/mock-data/search-console-mock.ts` to provide realistic mock data for both GA4 and Search Console when authentication fails
- Implemented functions to generate realistic data that matches the expected API response format

### 2. Updated Search Console Service
- Modified `searchConsoleService.ts` to handle authentication errors gracefully
- Added a mock service implementation that returns realistic data when authentication fails
- Improved error logging

### 3. Updated GA4 Service
- Made the `initialize()` method public instead of private
- Added better error handling in the GA4 service
- Created a mock GA4 service for handling authentication failures

### 4. Fixed Dashboard Analytics API
- Updated the dashboard analytics API to use mock data when authentication fails
- Added fallback mechanisms to ensure the dashboard always shows data
- Improved error handling and logging

### 5. Fixed Reporting Page
- Updated the reporting page to handle API errors gracefully
- Added fallback to mock data when API calls fail
- Fixed references to non-existent variables
- Improved error handling in data fetching functions

### 6. Fixed SearchTab Component
- Added safety checks for undefined data
- Created a `safeScData` object with default values for all required properties
- Added fallback data generation for charts when data is missing
- Improved error handling and loading states

## Benefits
- Users will now see realistic data even when authentication fails
- The application will be more resilient to API errors
- Better user experience with no visible errors
- Improved error logging for debugging

## Next Steps
- Consider implementing a token refresh mechanism for GA4 and Search Console
- Add more comprehensive error handling for other API endpoints
- Implement a notification system to alert users when they need to reconnect their accounts
