# Dealership Data Isolation & Analytics Verification Report

## Executive Summary

After thorough investigation of the dealership data isolation implementation, I've identified the key issue causing the "Acura of Columbus" data to persist when switching dealerships. The problem is that the dashboard component attempts to use localStorage to track the selected dealership, but this value is never being set when switching dealerships.

## Key Findings

### 1. ✅ Backend API Properly Handles Dealership Isolation

The analytics API endpoints correctly implement dealership data isolation:

- **`/api/dashboard/analytics/route.ts`**: 
  - Properly accepts `dealershipId` from request parameters (line 26)
  - Uses dealershipId in cache keys for proper isolation (line 29)
  - Correctly queries dealership-specific connections (lines 75-84, 89-99)
  - Falls back to user-level connections when no dealership-specific connection exists

- **`/api/dashboard/analytics-v2/route.ts`**:
  - Uses the centralized `DealershipAnalyticsService`
  - Properly passes dealershipId to the service (line 45)
  - Includes dealershipId in cache keys

### 2. ✅ DealershipAnalyticsService Correctly Isolates Data

The service (`/lib/google/dealership-analytics-service.ts`) properly:
- Queries dealership-specific connections first (lines 79-84, 162-167)
- Falls back to user-level connections if no dealership-specific connection exists
- Returns dealership-specific metadata including propertyId and siteUrl

### 3. ✅ Database Schema Supports Proper Isolation

Both `ga4_connections` and `search_console_connections` tables:
- Have optional `dealershipId` field for dealership-specific connections
- Use unique constraint on `[userId, dealershipId]` to prevent duplicates
- Support both user-level and dealership-level connections

### 4. ❌ Critical Issue: localStorage Not Being Set

**The main issue**: The dashboard component tries to read `selectedDealershipId` from localStorage (lines 161, 191), but this value is never set when switching dealerships.

```typescript
// Dashboard tries to read:
const currentDealershipId = localStorage.getItem('selectedDealershipId')

// But this is never set by the dealership switcher!
```

### 5. ✅ Dealership Switching Properly Updates Database

The `/api/dealerships/switch` endpoint:
- Correctly updates the user's `dealershipId` in the database (lines 89-92)
- Returns the new dealership information
- The DealershipContext properly dispatches a `dealershipChanged` event

### 6. ✅ Dashboard Listens for Dealership Changes

The dashboard component:
- Properly listens for the `dealershipChanged` event (line 256)
- Refreshes both dashboard stats and analytics when the event fires (lines 251-252)

## Root Cause Analysis

The data isolation is failing because:
1. When a dealership is switched, the database is updated but localStorage is not
2. The dashboard reads from localStorage to determine the current dealership
3. Since localStorage is empty/stale, the dashboard either uses no dealershipId or an old value
4. This causes the API to fall back to user-level connections, which might be showing data from a previously connected dealership

## Solution

The fix is simple - update the DealershipContext to also set localStorage when switching dealerships:

```typescript
// In DealershipContext.tsx, after line 117:
setCurrentDealership(newDealership)

// Add:
localStorage.setItem('selectedDealershipId', dealershipId)
```

## Verification Steps

1. **Check current behavior**:
   - Switch between dealerships
   - Check if GA4/Search Console data updates
   - Inspect localStorage for `selectedDealershipId`

2. **After implementing fix**:
   - Switch dealerships
   - Verify localStorage is updated
   - Confirm analytics data changes to reflect the selected dealership

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Consistency**: Consider using the DealershipContext's `currentDealership` instead of localStorage in the dashboard
2. **Clear localStorage on logout**: Ensure dealership selection doesn't persist across sessions
3. **Add logging**: Log dealershipId in API calls for easier debugging
4. **Consider using session storage**: If dealership selection shouldn't persist across browser sessions

## Conclusion

The dealership data isolation is properly implemented at the API and service levels. The issue is purely a frontend state management problem where localStorage is not being synchronized with the actual dealership selection. This simple fix should resolve the "Acura of Columbus" issue and ensure proper data isolation when switching between dealerships.
