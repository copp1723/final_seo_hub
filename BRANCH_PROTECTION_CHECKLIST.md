# GitHub Branch Protection Quick Setup Checklist

## ✅ Prerequisites Completed
- [x] GitHub Actions workflows created and pushed to main
- [x] CI workflow includes: Test & Lint, Build jobs
- [x] Security workflow includes: Security Audit job
- [x] Pull request template added
- [x] CODEOWNERS file configured
- [x] audit-ci dependency installed

## 🔧 GitHub Branch Protection Setup

### Step 1: Access Settings
1. Go to your repository on GitHub: https://github.com/copp1723/final_seo_hub
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Click **Branches** in left sidebar
4. Click **Add rule**

### Step 2: Configure Protection Rule

**Branch name pattern:** `main`

**✅ Check these boxes:**
- [ ] Require a pull request before merging
  - [ ] Require approvals: `1`
  - [ ] Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
  - [ ] Require review from code owners
- [ ] Require status checks to pass before merging
  - [ ] Require branches to be up to date before merging
- [ ] Restrict pushes that create matching branches
- [ ] Do not allow bypassing the above settings

**Required status checks to add:**
- [ ] `Test & Lint`
- [ ] `Build` 
- [ ] `Security Audit`

**Optional but recommended:**
- [ ] Require linear history
- [ ] Require signed commits

### Step 3: Save and Test
- [ ] Click **Create** to save the rule
- [ ] Create a test branch to verify protection works
- [ ] Create a test PR to verify CI runs

## 🚀 What This Achieves

✅ **Prevents direct pushes to main**
✅ **Requires PR reviews before merge**
✅ **Ensures all tests pass before merge**
✅ **Runs security audits on every change**
✅ **Enforces code quality with linting**
✅ **Validates TypeScript compilation**
✅ **Blocks force pushes to main**
