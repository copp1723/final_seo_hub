## Notes for Development Team

1. **Start with TICKET-001** - Nothing else works without navigation
2. **Test on mobile** - Many users will access on phones
3. **Use existing patterns** - Auth, API, and database patterns are established
4. **Ask about unknowns** - GA4 setup, email service choice, etc.
5. **Update documentation** - As you implement features

Each ticket should result in a PR with:
- Implementation
- Basic tests (where applicable)
- Documentation updates
- Screenshot/demo for UI changes
